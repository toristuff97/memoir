# react-photo-app

## Description
This project emulates a site like Instagram, where you can post photos and follow friends to see their pictures. Clicking on usernames will bring you to each profile, and clicking the links in the navbar will bring you to the different components.

## Technologies Used
I used Bootstrap, React Router, and a Material UI kit to create this app. It is written with HTML, JSX, and a bit of CSS.

## Issues
The pages do not reload automatically, so when you click on a link, you do have to refresh the page to see the new Component. In addition, I was not able to set up the Like function fully.
