# react-photo-app

## Description
This project emulates a site like Instagram, where you can post photos and follow friends to see their pictures. Clicking on usernames will bring you to each profile. 

## Technologies Used
I used Bootstrap, React Router, and a Material UI kit to create this app. It is written with HTML, JSX, and a bit of CSS.
